Version 2.0: 2025-02-23

### Purpose

This app illustrates different types of harvest strategies for Pacific salmon (Sockeye, Chinook, Coho, Chum, Pink). These species are *anadromous* (spawn in freshwater, migrate to the ocean, then return for spawning) and *semelparous* (spawn only once, then die).  Harvest targets for each year's returning run of salmon are typically set based on a spawning target or an exploitation rate target. Targets may be fixed or change with abundance.

### How to use the App

The app displays different types of harvest strategy, and shows the implied targets at different levels of abundance. For example, if a stock is managed to a fixed escapement target of 30,000, what are the *implied* exploitation rate and catch targets at 5,000 or 50,000 or 150,000 run size?

Users can change the specifications for each type of harvest rule (e.g. set the fixed exploitation rate, or set the steps for a stepped ER rule) and vary the abundance estimate (e.g. median and lower/upper bounds on in-season run size estimate).
